==== Super Streams (Partitioned Streams)

WARNING: Super Streams require *RabbitMQ 3.11* or more.

A super stream is a logical stream made of several individual streams.
In essence, a super stream is a partitioned stream that brings scalability compared to a single stream.

The stream .NET client uses the same programming model for super streams as with individual streams, that is the `Producer`, `Consumer`, `Message`, etc API are still valid when super streams are in use.
Application code should not be impacted whether it uses individual or super streams.

Consuming applications can use super streams and <<api.adoc#single-active-consumer, single active consumer>> at the same time.
The 2 features combined make sure only one consumer instance consumes from an individual stream at a time.
In this configuration, super streams provide scalability and single active consumer provides the guarantee that messages of an individual stream are processed in order.

[WARNING]
.Super streams do not deprecate streams
====
Super streams are a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_(database)[partitioning] solution.
They are not meant to replace individual streams, they sit on top of them to handle some use cases in a better way.
If the stream data is likely to be large – hundreds of gigabytes or even terabytes, size remains relative – and even presents an obvious partition key (e.g. country), a super stream can be appropriate.
It can help to cope with the data size and to take advantage of data locality for some processing use cases.
Remember that partitioning always comes with complexity though, even if the implementation of super streams strives to make it as transparent as possible for the application developer.
====


===== Topology

A super stream is made of several individual streams, so it can be considered a logical entity rather than an actual physical entity.
The topology of a super stream is based on the https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/amqp-concepts.html[AMQP 0.9.1 model], that is exchange, queues, and bindings between them.
This does not mean AMQP resources are used to transport or store stream messages, it means that they are used to _describe_ the super stream topology, that is the streams it is made of.

Let's take the example of an `invoices` super stream made of 3 streams (i.e. partitions):

* an `invoices` exchange represents the super stream
* the `invoices-0`, `invoices-1`, `invoices-2` streams are the partitions of the super stream (streams are also AMQP queues in RabbitMQ)
* 3 bindings between the exchange and the streams link the super stream to its partitions and represent _routing rules_

.The topology of a super stream is defined with bindings between an exchange and queues

....
                 0    +------------+
               +----->+ invoices–0 |
               |      +------------+
+----------+   |
| invoices |   | 1    +------------+
|          +---+----->+ invoices–1 |
| exchange |   |      +------------+
+----------+   |
               | 2    +------------+
               +----->+ invoices–2 |
                      +------------+
....

When a super stream is in use, the stream NET client queries this information to find out about the partitions of a super stream and the routing rules.
From the application code point of view, using a super stream is mostly configuration-based.
Some logic must also be provided to extract routing information from messages.

===== Super Stream Creation

It is possible to create the topology of a super stream with any AMQP 0.9.1 library or with the https://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html[management plugin], but the `rabbitmq-streams add_super_stream` command is a handy shortcut.
Here is how to create an invoices super stream with 3 partitions:

.Creating a super stream from the CLI
----
rabbitmq-streams add_super_stream invoices --partitions 3
----

Use `rabbitmq-streams add_super_stream --help` to learn more about the command.

[[super-stream-producer]]
===== Publishing to a Super Stream

When the topology of a super stream like the one described above has been set, creating a producer for it is straightforward:

.Creating a Producer for a Super Stream
[source,java,indent=0]
--------
include::{test-examples}/SuperStreamProducer.cs[tag=super-stream-producer]
--------
<1> Configure the `Producer` with the super stream name
<2> Enable the Super Stream mode
<3> Provide the logic to get the routing key from a message
<4> Send the messages to the super stream

Note that even though the `invoices` super stream is not an actual stream, its name must be used to declare the producer.
Internally the client will figure out the streams that compose the super stream.
The application code must provide the logic to extract a routing key from a message as a `Function<Message, String>`.
The client will hash the routing key to determine the stream to send the message to (using partition list and a modulo operation).

The client uses 32-bit https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MurmurHash[MurmurHash3] by default to hash the routing key.
This hash function provides good uniformity and it is compatible with the other clients.


====== Deduplication

Deduplication for a super stream producer works the same way as with a <<api.adoc#outbound-message-deduplication, single stream producer>>.
The publishing ID values are spread across the streams but this does affect the mechanism.

.Creating a DeduplicatingProducer for a Super Stream
[source,java,indent=0]
--------
include::{test-examples}/SuperStreamDeduplicatingProducer.cs[tag=super-ded-stream-producer]
--------
<1> Configure the `DeduplicatingProducer` with the super stream name and the reference.
<2> Enable the Super Stream mode
<3> Provide the logic to get the routing key from a message. Send the messages providing the publishing ID.


===== Consuming From a Super Stream

A super stream consumer is a composite consumer: it will look up the super stream partitions and create a consumer for each or them.
The programming model is the same as with regular consumers for the application developer: their main job is to provide the application code to process messages, that is a `MessageHandler` instance.
The configuration is different though and this section covers its subtleties.
But let's focus on the behavior of a super stream consumer first.

[[super-stream-consumer-in-practice]]
====== Super Stream Consumer in Practice

Imagine you have a super stream made of 3 partitions (individual streams).
You start an instance of your application, that itself creates a super stream consumer for this super stream.
The super stream consumer will create 3 consumers internally, one for each partition, and messages will flow in your `MessageHandler`.

Imagine now that you start another instance of your application.
It will do the exact same thing as previously and the 2 instances will process the exact same messages in parallel.
This may be not what you want: the messages will be processed twice!

Having one instance of your application may be enough: the data are spread across several streams automatically and the messages from the different partitions are processed in parallel from a single OS process.

But if you want to scale the processing across several OS processes (or bare-metal machines, or virtual machines) and you don't want your messages to be processed several times as illustrated above, you'll have to enable the *single active consumer* feature on your super stream consumer.

The next subsections cover the basic settings of a super stream consumer and a <<super-stream-sac, dedicated section>> covers how super stream consumers and single active consumer play together.

====== Declaring a Super Stream Consumer

Declaring a super stream consumer is not much different from declaring a single stream consumer.
The `Consumer.Create(..)` must be used to set the super stream to consume from:

.Declaring a super stream consumer
[source,java,indent=0]
--------
include::{test-examples}/SuperStreamConsumer.cs[tag=consumer-simple]
--------
<1> Set the super stream name
<2> Close the consumer when it is no longer necessary

That's all.
The super stream consumer will take of the details (partitions lookup, coordination of the single consumers, etc).

====== Offset Tracking

The semantic of offset tracking for a super stream consumer are roughly the same as for an individual stream consumer.
There are still some subtle differences, so a good understanding of <<api.adoc#consumer-offset-tracking, offset tracking>>.

The offset tracking is per stream.



[[super-stream-sac]]
====== Single Active Consumer Support

WARNING: Single Active Consumer requires *RabbitMQ 3.11* or more.

As <<super-stream-consumer-in-practice, stated previously>>, super stream consumers and single active consumer provide scalability and the guarantee that messages of an individual stream are processed in order.

Let's take an example with a 3-partition super stream:

* You have an application that creates a super stream consumer instance with single active consumer enabled.
* You start 3 instances of this application. An instance in this case is a JVM process, which can be in a Docker container, a virtual machine, or a bare-metal server.
* As the super stream has 3 partitions, each application instance will create a super stream consumer that maintains internally 3 consumer instances.
That is 9 Java instances of consumer overall.
Such a super stream consumer is a _composite consumer_.
* The broker and the different application instances coordinate so that only 1 consumer instance for a given partition receives messages at a time.
So among these 9 consumer instances, only 3 are actually _active_, the other ones are idle or _inactive_.
* If one of the application instances stops, the broker will _rebalance_ its active consumer to one of the other instances.

The following figure illustrates how the client library supports the combination of the super stream and single active consumer features.
It uses a composite consumer that creates an individual consumer for each partition of the super stream.
If there is only one single active consumer instance with a given name for a super stream, each individual consumer is active.

Imagine now we start 3 instances of the consuming application to scale out the processing.
The individual consumer instances spread out across the super stream partitions and only one is active for each partition, as illustrated in the following figure:

....

After this overview, let's see the API and the configuration details.

Note it is mandatory to specify a Reference for the consumer.
This name will be used to identify the _group_ of consumer instances and make sure only one is active for each partition.
The name is also the reference for offset tracking.

The example above uses by default <<api.adoc#consumer-manual-offset-tracking, manual offset tracking>>.
It looks up the latest stored offset when a consumer becomes active to start consuming at the appropriate offset and it stores the last dispatched offset when a consumer becomes inactive.

The story is not the same with <<api.adoc#consumer-manual-offset-tracking, manual offset tracking>> as the client library does not know which offset it should store when a consumer becomes inactive.
The application developer can use the <<api.adoc#consumer-update-listener, `ConsumerUpdateListener)` callback>> to react appropriately when a consumer changes state.
The following snippet illustrates the use of the `ConsumerUpdateListener` callback:

.Using manual offset tracking for a super stream single active consumer
[source,c#,indent=0]
--------
include::{test-examples}/SuperStreamConsumer.cs[tag=sac-manual-offset-tracking]
--------
<1> Store manually the offset
<2> Enable single active consumer
<3> Set `ConsumerUpdateListener`
<4> Return stored offset + 1 or default when consumer becomes active

The `ConsumerUpdateListener` callback must return the offset to start consuming from when a consumer becomes active.
This is what the code above does: it checks if the consumer is active with `ConsumerUpdateListener#isActive()` and looks up the last stored offset.
If there is no stored offset yet, it returns a default value, `OffsetTypeNext()` here.

When a consumer becomes inactive, it should store the last processed offset, as another consumer instance will take over elsewhere.
It is expected this other consumer runs the exact same code, so it will execute the same sequence when it becomes active (looking up the stored offset, returning the value + 1).

Note the `ConsumerUpdateListener` is called for a _partition_, that is an individual stream.

RabbitMQ Stream provides server-side offset tracking, but it is possible to use an external store to track offsets for streams.
The `ConsumerUpdateListener` callback is still your friend in this case.
