=== Sample Application

This section covers the basics of the RabbitMQ Stream .NET API by building
a small publish/consume application. This is a good way to get
an overview of the API. 

// TODO
// If you want a more comprehensive introduction,
//you can go to the <<api.adoc#rabbitmq-stream-java-api,reference documentation section>>.

The sample application publishes some messages and then registers
a consumer to make some computations out of them. The
https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-stream-dotnet-client/blob/main/doc/Documentation/GettingStarted.cs[source code is available on GitHub].

The sample class starts with a few imports:

.Imports for the sample application
[source,c#,indent=0]
--------
include::{test-examples}/GettingStarted.cs[tag=sample-imports]
--------
<1>  `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging` is used to log the events. ( not shipped with the client)
<2> `RabbitMQ.Stream.Client` is the main package to use the client
<3> `RabbitMQ.Stream.Client.Reliable` contains the `Producer` and `Consumer` implementations

The next step is to create the `StreamSystem`. It is a management object
used to manage streams and create producers as well as consumers. The
next snippet shows how to create an `StreamSystem` instance and
create the stream used in the application:

.Creating the environment
[source,c#,indent=0]
--------
include::{test-examples}/GettingStarted.cs[tag=sample-system]
--------
<1> Use `StreamSystem.Create(..)` to create the environment
<2> Define the connection configuration
<3> Add the logger. (Not mandatory it is very useful to understand what is going on)
<4> Create the stream
<5> Define the retention policy

Then comes the publishing part. The next snippet shows how to create
a `Producer`, send messages, and handle publishing confirmations, to
make sure the broker has taken outbound messages into account.

.Publishing messages
[source,c#,indent=0]
--------
include::{test-examples}/GettingStarted.cs[tag=sample-producer]
--------
<1> Create the `Producer` with `Producer.Create`
<2> Define the `ConfirmationHandler` where the messages are confirmed or not
<3> Message is confirmed from the server
<4> Message not confirmed
<5> Add the logger. (Not mandatory it is very useful to understand what is going on)
<6> Send messages with `producer.Send(Message)`
<7> Wait for messages confirmation
<8> Close the producer

It is now time to consume the messages. The `Consumer.Create` lets us create a `Consumer`
and provide some logic on each incoming message by implementing a `MessageHandler`.
The next snippet does this to calculate a sum and output it once all the messages
have been received:

.Consuming messages
[source,c#,indent=0]
--------
include::{test-examples}/GettingStarted.cs[tag=sample-consumer]
--------
<1> Create the `Consumer` with `Consumer.Create`
<2> Start consuming from the beginning of the stream
<3> Set up the logic to handle message
<4> Add the logger. (Not mandatory it is very useful to understand what is going on)
<5> Wait for all the messages are consumed
<6> Close the consumer

.Cleaning before terminating
[source,c#,indent=0]
--------
include::{test-examples}/GettingStarted.cs[tag=sample-close]
--------
<1> Delete the stream
<2> Close the stream system


.About logging
[source,c#,indent=0]
--------
include::{test-examples}/GettingStarted.cs[tag=sample-logging]
--------
<1> Define the logger for the producer
<2> Define the logger for the consumer
<3> Define the logger for the stream system

The client is shipped with only with `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions` and you can use any logger you want.

The logger is not mandatory but it is highly recommended to configure it to understand what is happening.
In this example, we are using `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Console` to log to the console.
`Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Console` is not shipped with the client.

.Run the sample application
You can run the sample application from the root of the project (you need
a running local RabbitMQ node with the stream plugin enabled):

----
$  dotnet run --gs
Starting publishing...
*********************************
All the 100 messages are confirmed
*********************************
Starting consuming...
*********************************
All the 100 messages are received
*********************************
