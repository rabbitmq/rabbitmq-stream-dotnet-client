== Low Level and High Level classes

.NET stream client provides  two types of classes:

* Low-level classes
* High-level classes

High-level classes (`Producer` and `Consumer`) are a wrapper around the Low-Level classes (`Raw*Producer` and `Raw*Consumer`)

`Producer` and `Consumer` classes handle auto-reconnection, metadata updates, super-stream and some low-level client behaviour.

It would be best to use `Producer` and `Consumer` classes unless you need to handle the low-level details.
