=== RabbitMQ Stream .NET API

==== Overview

This section describes the API to connect to the RabbitMQ Stream Plugin, publish messages, and
consume messages. There are 3 main interfaces:

* `RabbitMQ.Stream.Client` for connecting to a node and optionally
managing streams.
* `RabbitMQ.Stream.Client.Reliable.Producer` to publish messages.
* `RabbitMQ.Stream.Client.Reliable.Consumer` to consume messages.

==== StreamSystem

===== Creating the StreamSystem

The environment is the main entry point to a node or a cluster of nodes. `Producer` and
`Consumer` instances need an `StreamSystem` instance. Here is the simplest
way to create an `StreamSystem` instance:

.Creating an environment with all the defaults
[source,java,indent=0]
--------
include::{test-examples}/StreamSystemUsage.cs[tag=create-simple]
--------
<1> Create an environment that will connect to localhost:5552
<2> Close the environment after usage

Note the streamSystem must be closed to release resources when it is no
longer needed.

Consider the environment like a long-lived object. An application will usually
create one `StreamSystem` instance when it starts up and close it when it exits.

It is possible to use a multiple end-points to connect to a cluster of nodes. The:

.Creating an streamSystem with multiple end-points
[source,java,indent=0]
--------
include::{test-examples}/StreamSystemUsage.cs[tag=create-multi-endpoints]
--------
<1>  Define the end-points to connect to

By specifying several endpoints, the system will try to connect to the first one, and
will pick a new endpoint randomly in case of disconnection.

[[understanding-connection-logic]]
===== Understanding Connection Logic

Creating the StreamSystem to connect to a cluster node works usually seamlessly.
Creating publishers and consumers can cause problems as the client uses hints from the cluster to find the nodes where stream leaders and replicas are located to connect to the appropriate nodes.

These connection hints can be accurate or less appropriate depending on the infrastructure.
If you hit some connection problems at some point â€“ like hostnames impossible to resolve for client applications - this https://blog.rabbitmq.com/posts/2021/07/connecting-to-streams/[blog post] should help you understand what is going on and fix the issues.

===== Enabling TLS

The default TLS port is 5551.

.Creating an StreamSystem that uses TLS
[source,java,indent=0]
--------
include::{test-examples}/StreamSystemUsage.cs[tag=create-tls]
--------
<1> Enable TLS
<2> Load certificate authority (CA) certificate from PEM file

.Creating a TLS environment that trusts all server certificates for development
[source,java,indent=0]
--------
include::{test-examples}/StreamSystemUsage.cs[tag=create-tls-trust]
--------
<1> Trust all server certificates

===== Configuring the Stream System

The following table sums up the main settings to create an `StreamSystem` using the `StreamSystemConfig`:

[%header,cols=3*]
|===
|Parameter Name
|Description
|Default

|`UserName`
|User name to use to connect.
|`guest`

|`Password`
|Password to use to connect.
|`guest`

|`VirtualHost`
|Virtual host to connect to.
|`/`

|`ClientProvidedName`
| To identify the client in the management UI. 
|`dotnet-stream-locator`

|`Heartbeat`
|Time between heartbeats.
|`1 minute`

|`Endpoints`
|The list of endpoints to connect to.
|`localhost:5552`


|`addressResolver`
|Contract to change resolved node address to connect to.
|Pass-through (no-op)

|`Ssl`
|Configuration helper for TLS.
|`null`

|===

===== When a Load Balancer is in Use

A load balancer can misguide the client when it tries to connect to nodes that host stream leaders and replicas.
The https://blog.rabbitmq.com/posts/2021/07/connecting-to-streams/["Connecting to Streams"] blog post covers why client applications must connect to the appropriate nodes in a cluster and how a https://blog.rabbitmq.com/posts/2021/07/connecting-to-streams/#with-a-load-balancer[load balancer can make things complicated] for them.

The `StreamSystemConfig#AddressResolver(AddressResolver)` method allows intercepting the node resolution after metadata hints and before connection.
Applications can use this hook to ignore metadata hints and always use the load balancer, as illustrated in the following snippet:

.Using a custom address resolver to always use a load balancer
[source,java,indent=0]
--------
include::{test-examples}/StreamSystemUsage.cs[tag=create-address-resolver]
--------
<1> Set the load balancer address
<2> Use load balancer address for initial connection
<3> Set the endpoints based on `AddressResolver` 

The blog post covers the https://blog.rabbitmq.com/posts/2021/07/connecting-to-streams/#client-workaround-with-a-load-balancer[underlying details of this workaround].

===== Managing Streams

Streams are usually long-lived, centrally-managed entities, that is, applications
are not supposed to create and delete them. It is nevertheless possible to create and
delete stream with the `StreamSystem`. This comes in handy for development and testing
purposes.

Streams are created with the `Environment#streamCreator()` method:

.Creating a stream
[source,java,indent=0]
--------
include::{test-examples}/StreamSystemUsage.cs[tag=stream-creation]
--------
<1> Create the `my-stream` stream

`StreamSystem.Create` is idempotent: trying to re-create a stream with the same name
and same properties (e.g. maximum size, see below) will not throw an exception. In other words,
you can be sure the stream has been created once `StreamSystem.Create` returns. Note it is
not possible to create a stream with the same name as an existing stream but with different
properties. Such a request will result in an exception.

Streams can be deleted with the `Environment#delete(String)` method:

.Deleting a stream
[source,java,indent=0]
--------
include::{test-examples}/StreamSystemUsage.cs[tag=stream-deletion]
--------
<1> Delete the `my-stream` stream

Note you should avoid stream churn (creating and deleting streams repetitively)
as their creation and deletion imply some significant housekeeping on
the server side (interactions with the file system, communication between nodes of the cluster).

[[limiting-the-size-of-a-stream]]It is also possible to limit the size of a stream
when creating it. A stream
is an append-only data structure and reading from it does not remove data.
This means a stream can grow indefinitely. RabbitMQ Stream supports a
size-based and time-based retention policies: once the stream reaches a given size
or a given age, it is truncated (starting from the beginning).

[IMPORTANT]
.Limit the size of streams if appropriate!
====
Make sure to set up a retention policy on potentially large streams
if you don't want to saturate the storage devices of your servers. Keep
in mind that this means some data will be erased!
====

It is possible to set up the retention policy when creating the stream:

.Setting the retention policy when creating a stream
[source,java,indent=0]
--------
include::{test-examples}/StreamSystemUsage.cs[tag=stream-creation-retention]
--------
<1> Set the maximum size to 10 GB
<2> Set the segment size to 500 MB

The previous snippet mentions a segment size. RabbitMQ Stream does not store a stream
in a big, single file, it uses segment files for technical reasons.
A stream is truncated by deleting whole segment files (and not part of them)so
the maximum size of a stream is usually significantly higher than the size of
segment files. 500 MB is a reasonable segment file size to begin with.

[NOTE]
.When does the broker enforce the retention policy?
====
The broker enforces the retention policy when the segments of a stream
roll over, that is when the current segment has reached its maximum
size and is closed in favor of a new one. This means the maximum segment
size is a critical setting in the retention mechanism.
====

RabbitMQ Stream also supports a time-based retention policy: segments get truncated
when they reach a certain age. The following snippet
illustrates how to set the time-based retention policy:

.Setting a time-based retention policy when creating a stream
[source,java,indent=0]
--------
include::{test-examples}/StreamSystemUsage.cs[tag=stream-creation-time-based-retention]
--------
<1> Set the maximum age to 6 hours
<2> Set the segment size to 500 MB

==== Producer

===== Creating a Producer

A `Producer` instance is created with `Producer.Create`. The only mandatory
setting to specify is the stream to publish to:

.Creating a producer from the environment
[source,java,indent=0]
--------
include::{test-examples}/ProducerUsage.cs[tag=producer-creation]
--------
<1> Use `Producer.Create` to define the producer
<2> Specify the stream to publish to
<3> Close the producer after usage

Consider a `Producer` instance like a long-lived object, do not create one
to send just one message.


[NOTE]
.Producer thread safety
====
`Producer` instances are thread-safe when `Reference` is not set.
Starting from version 1.2.0 the `Reference` field is deprecated. 
`Reference` is needed for deduplication see the Deduplication section for more details.
====

Internally, the `StreamSystem` will query the broker to find out about
the topology of the stream and will create or re-use a connection to
publish to the leader node of the stream.

The following table sums up the main settings to create a `ProducerConfig`:

[%header,cols=3*]
|===
|Parameter Name
|Description
|Default

|`StreamSystem`
|The StreamSystem to use to create the producer.
|No default, mandatory setting.

|`stream`
|The stream to publish to.
|No default, mandatory setting.

|`Reference`
|The logical name of the producer. Specify a name to enable
<<outbound-message-deduplication,message deduplication>>.
|`null` (no deduplication) - Deprecated in version 1.2.0

|`ConfirmationHandler`
|The confirmation handler where received the messages confirmations.
|`null` (no confirmation handler)

|ClientProvidedName
|The TCP connection name to identify the client.
|`dotnet-stream-producer` 

|`MaxInFlight`
|The maximum number of messages that can be in flight at any given time. Messages sent - Messages confirmed. To avoid to flood the broker with messages.
|1000

|`ReconnectStrategy`
|The strategy to use when the connection to the broker is lost.
|`BackOffReconnectStrategy`

|`MessagesBufferSize`
|Number of the messages sent for each frame-send.
This value is valid only for the `Send(Message)` method.
|100 ms

|`confirmTimeout`
|[[producer-confirm-timeout-configuration-entry]]Time before the client calls the confirm callback to signal
outstanding unconfirmed messages timed out.
|30 seconds

|`enqueueTimeout`
|Time before enqueueing of a message fail when the maximum number of unconfirmed
is reached. The callback of the message will be called with a negative status.
Set the value to `Duration.ZERO` if there should be no timeout.
|10 seconds.
|===

===== Sending Messages

Once a `Producer` has been created, it is possible to send a message with
the `Producer#send(Message, ConfirmationHandler)` method. The following
snippet shows how to publish a message with a byte array payload:

.Sending a message
[source,java,indent=0]
--------
include::{test-examples}/ProducerUsage.java[tag=producer-publish]
--------
<1> The payload of a message is an array of bytes
<2> Create the message with `Producer#messageBuilder()`
<3> Define the behavior on publish confirmation

Messages are not only made of a `byte[]` payload, we will see in
<<working-with-complex-messages,the next section>>
they can also carry pre-defined and application properties.

[NOTE]
.Use a `MessageBuilder` instance only once
====
A `MessageBuilder` instance is meant to create only one message. You
need to create a new instance of `MessageBuilder` for every message
you want to create.
====

The `ConfirmationHandler` defines an asynchronous callback invoked
when the client received from the broker the confirmation the message
has been taken into account. The `ConfirmationHandler` is the place
for any logic on publishing confirmation, including
re-publishing the message if it is negatively acknowledged.

[WARNING]
.Keep the confirmation callback as short as possible
====
The confirmation callback should be kept as short as possible
to avoid blocking the connection thread. Not doing so can
make the `Environment`, `Producer`, `Consumer` instances sluggish
or even block them. Any long processing should be done in
a separate thread (e.g. with an asynchronous `ExecutorService`).
====

[[working-with-complex-messages]]
===== Working with Complex Messages

The publishing example above showed that messages are made of
a byte array payload, but it did not go much further. Messages in RabbitMQ Stream
can actually be more sophisticated, as they comply to the
https://www.amqp.org/resources/specifications[AMQP 1.0 message format].

In a nutshell, a message in RabbitMQ Stream has the following structure:

* properties: _a defined set of standard properties of the message_ (e.g.
message ID, correlation ID, content type, etc).
* application properties: a set of arbitrary key/value pairs.
* body: typically an array of bytes.
* message annotations: a set of key/value pairs (aimed at the infrastructure).

The RabbitMQ Stream Java client uses the `Message` interface to abstract
a message and the recommended way to create `Message` instances is to
use the `Producer#messageBuilder()` method. To publish a `Message`, use
the `Producer#send(Message,ConfirmationHandler)`:

.Creating a message with properties
[source,java,indent=0]
--------
include::{test-examples}/ProducerUsage.java[tag=producer-publish-complex-message]
--------
<1> Get the message builder from the producer
<2> Get the properties builder and set some properties
<3> Go back to message builder
<4> Set byte array payload
<5> Build the message instance
<6> Publish the message

[NOTE]
.Is RabbitMQ Stream based on AMQP 1.0?
====
AMQP 1.0 is a standard that defines _an efficient binary peer-to-peer
protocol for transporting messages between two processes over a network_.
It also defines _an abstract message format, with concrete standard encoding_.
This is only the latter part that RabbitMQ Stream uses. The AMQP 1.0 protocol is not used,
only AMQP 1.0 encoded messages are wrapped into the RabbitMQ Stream binary protocol.

The actual AMQP 1.0 message encoding and decoding happen on the client side, the
RabbitMQ Stream plugin stores only bytes, it has no idea that AMQP 1.0 message format
is used.

AMQP 1.0 message format was chosen because of its flexibility and its advanced
type system. It provides good interoperability, which allows streams
to be accessed as AMQP 0-9-1 queues, without data loss.
====

[[outbound-message-deduplication]]
===== Message Deduplication

RabbitMQ Stream provides publisher confirms to avoid losing messages: once
the broker has persisted a message it sends a confirmation for this message.
But this can lead to duplicate messages: imagine the connection closes
because of a network glitch after the message has been persisted but _before_
the confirmation reaches the producer. Once reconnected, the producer will
retry to send the same message, as it never received the confirmation. So the
message will be persisted twice.

Luckily RabbitMQ Stream can detect and filter out duplicated messages, based
on 2 client-side elements: the _producer name_ and the _message publishing ID_.

[WARNING]
.Deduplication is not guaranteed when using sub-entries batching
====
It is not possible to guarantee deduplication when
<<sub-entry-batching-and-compression, sub-entry batching>> is in use.
Sub-entry batching is disabled by default and it does not prevent from
batching messages in a single publish frame, which can already provide
very high throughput.
====

[[deduplication-multithreading]]
[WARNING]
.Deduplication is not guaranteed when publishing on several threads
====
We'll see below that deduplication works using a strictly increasing sequence for messages.
This means messages must be published in order and the preferred way to do this is usually _within a single thread_.
Even if messages are _created_ in order, with the proper sequence ID, if they are published in several threads, they can get out of order, e.g. message 5 can be _published_ before message 2.
The deduplication mechanism will then filter out message 2 in this case.

So you have to be very careful about the way your applications publish messages when deduplication is in use.
If you worry about performance, note it is possible to publish hundreds of thousands of messages in a single thread with RabbitMQ Stream.
====

====== Setting the Name of a Producer

The producer name is set when creating the producer instance, which automatically
enables deduplication:

.Naming a producer to enable message deduplication
[source,java,indent=0]
--------
include::{test-examples}/ProducerUsage.java[tag=producer-with-name]
--------
<1> Set a name for the producer
<2> Disable confirm timeout check

Thanks to the name, the broker will be able to track the messages it has persisted
on a given stream for this producer. If the producer connection unexpectedly closes, it
will automatically recover and retry outstanding messages. The broker will then
filter out messages it has already received and persisted. No more duplicates!

[IMPORTANT]
.Why setting `confirmTimeout` to 0 when using deduplication?
====
The point of deduplication is to avoid duplicates when retrying unconfirmed messages.
But why retrying in the first place? To avoid _losing_ messages, that is enforcing
_at-least-once_ semantics. If the client does not stubbornly retry messages and gives
up at some point, messages can be lost, which maps to _at-most-once_ semantics. This
is why the deduplication examples set the
<<producer-confirm-timeout-configuration-entry,`confirmTimeout` setting>> to `Duration.ZERO`:
to disable the background task that calls the confirmation callback for outstanding
messages that time out. This way the client will do its best to retry messages
until they are confirmed.
====

Consider the producer name a logical name. It should not be a random sequence that
changes when the producer application is restarted. Names like `online-shop-order` or
`online-shop-invoice` are better names than `3d235e79-047a-46a6-8c80-9d159d3e1b05`.
There should be only one living instance of a producer with a given name on a given
stream at the same time.

====== Understanding Publishing ID

The producer name is only one part of the deduplication mechanism, the other part
is the _message publishing ID_. If the producer has a name, the client automatically
assigns a publishing ID to each outbound message for the producer. The publishing ID
is a strictly increasing sequence, starting at 0 and incremented for each message. The default
publishing sequence is good enough for deduplication, but it is possible to
assign a publishing ID to each message:

.Using an explicit publishing ID
[source,java,indent=0]
--------
include::{test-examples}/ProducerUsage.java[tag=message-with-publishing-id]
--------
<1> Set a publishing ID on a message

There are a few rules to follow when using a custom publishing ID sequence:

 * the sequence should start at 0
 * the sequence must be strictly increasing
 * there can be gaps in the sequence (e.g. 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9, 10, etc)

A custom publishing ID sequence has usually a meaning: it can be the line number of a file
or the primary key in a database.

Note the publishing ID is not part of the message: it is not stored with the message
and so is not available when consuming the message. It is still possible to store
the value in the AMQP 1.0 message application properties or in an appropriate
properties (e.g. `messageId`).

[IMPORTANT]
.Do not mix client-assigned and custom publishing ID
====
As soon as a producer name is set, message deduplication is enabled.
It is then possible to let the producer assign a publishing ID to each
message or assign custom publishing IDs. *Do one or the other, not both!*
====

====== Restarting a Producer Where It Left Off

Using a custom publishing sequence is even more useful to restart a producer where it left
off. Imagine a scenario whereby the producer is sending a message for each line in a file and
the application uses the line number as the publishing ID. If the application restarts
because of some necessary maintenance or even a crash, the producer can restart
from the beginning of the file: there would no duplicate messages because the producer
has a name and the application sets publishing IDs appropriately. Nevertheless,
this is far from ideal, it would be much better to restart just after the last line
the broker successfully confirmed. Fortunately this is possible thanks to
the `Producer#getLastPublishing()` method, which returns the last publishing ID for a given
producer. As the publishing ID in this case is the line number, the application can
easily scroll to the next line and restart publishing from there.

The next snippet illustrates the use of `Producer#getLastPublishing()`:

.Setting a producer where it left off
[source,java,indent=0]
--------
include::{test-examples}/ProducerUsage.java[tag=producer-queries-last-publishing-id]
--------
<1> Set a name for the producer
<2> Disable confirm timeout check
<3> Query last publishing ID for this producer and increment it
<4> Scroll to the content for the next publishing ID
<5> Set the message publishing

[[sub-entry-batching-and-compression]]
===== Sub-Entry Batching and Compression

RabbitMQ Stream provides a special mode to publish, store, and dispatch messages: sub-entry batching.
This mode increases throughput at the cost of increased latency and potential duplicated messages even when deduplication is enabled.
It also allows using compression to reduce bandwidth and storage if messages are reasonably similar, at the cost of increasing CPU usage on the client side.

Sub-entry batching consists in squeezing several messages â€“ a batch â€“ in the slot that is usually used for one message.
This means outbound messages are not only batched in publishing frames, but in sub-entries as well.

You can enable sub-entry batching by setting the `ProducerBuilder#subEntrySize` parameter to a value greater than 1, like in the following snippet:

.Enabling sub-entry batching
[source,java,indent=0]
--------
include::{test-examples}/ProducerUsage.java[tag=producer-sub-entry-batching]
--------
<1> Set batch size to 100 (the default)
<2> Set sub-entry size to 10

Reasonable values for the sub-entry size usually go from 10 to a few dozens.

A sub-entry batch will go directly to disc after it reached the broker, so the publishing client has complete control over it.
This is the occasion to take advantage of the similarity of messages and compress them.
There is no compression by default but you can choose among several algorithms with the `ProducerBuilder#compression(Compression)` method:

.Enabling compression of sub-entry messages
[source,java,indent=0]
--------
include::{test-examples}/ProducerUsage.java[tag=producer-sub-entry-batching-and-compression]
--------
<1> Set batch size to 100 (the default)
<2> Set sub-entry size to 10
<3> Use the Zstandard compression algorithm

Note the messages in a sub-entry are compressed altogether to benefit from their potential similarity, not one by one.

The following table lists the supported algorithms, general information about them, and the respective implementations used by default.

[%header,cols=3*]
|===
|Algorithm
|Overview
|Implementation used

|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gzip[gzip]
|Has a high compression ratio but is slow compared to other algorithms.
|JDK implementation

|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snappy_(compression)[Snappy]
|Aims for reasonable compression ratio and very high speeds.
|https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java[Xerial Snappy] (framed)

|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZ4_(compression_algorithm)[LZ4]
|Aims for good trade-off between speed and compression ratio.
|https://github.com/lz4/lz4-java[LZ4 Java] (framed)

|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zstd[zstd] (Zstandard)
|Aims for high compression ratio and high speed, especially for decompression.
|https://github.com/luben/zstd-jni[zstd-jni]
|===

You are encouraged to test and evaluate the compression algorithms depending on your needs.

The compression libraries are pluggable thanks to the `EnvironmentBuilder#compressionCodecFactory(CompressionCodecFactory)` method.


[NOTE]
.Consumers, sub-entry batching, and compression
====
There is no configuration required for consumers with regard to sub-entry batching and compression.
The broker dispatches messages to client libraries: they are supposed to figure out the format of messages, extract them from their sub-entry, and decompress them if necessary.
So when you set up sub-entry batching and compression in your publishers, the consuming applications must use client libraries that support this mode, which is the case for the stream Java client.
====

==== Consumer

`Consumer` is the API to consume messages from a stream.

===== Creating a Consumer

A `Consumer` instance is created with `Environment#consumerBuilder()`. The main
settings are the stream to consume from, the place in the stream to start
consuming from (the _offset_), and a callback when a message is received
(the `MessageHandler`). The next snippet shows how to create a `Consumer`:

.Creating a consumer
[source,java,indent=0]
--------
include::{test-examples}/ConsumerUsage.java[tag=producer-creation]
--------
<1> Use `Environment#consumerBuilder()` to define the consumer
<2> Specify the stream to consume from
<3> Specify where to start consuming from
<4> Define behavior on message consumption
<5> Build the consumer
<6> Close consumer after usage

The broker start sending messages as soon as the `Consumer` instance is created.

[WARNING]
.Keep the message processing callback as short as possible
====
The message processing callback should be kept as short as possible
to avoid blocking the connection thread. Not doing so can
make the `Environment`, `Producer`, `Consumer` instances sluggish
or even block them. Any long processing should be done in
a separate thread (e.g. with an asynchronous `ExecutorService`).
====

The following table sums up the main settings to create a `Consumer`:

[%header,cols=3*]
|===
|Parameter Name
|Description
|Default

|`stream`
|The stream to consume from.
|No default, mandatory setting.

|`offset`
|The offset to start consuming from.
|`OffsetSpecification#next()`

|`messageHandler`
|The callback for inbound messages.
|No default, mandatory setting.

|`name`
|The consumer name (for <<consumer-offset-tracking,offset tracking>>.)
|`null` (no offset tracking)

|`AutoTrackingStrategy`
|Enable and configure the <<consumer-automatic-offset-tracking,auto-tracking strategy>>.
|This is the default tracking strategy if a consumer `name` is provided.

|`AutoTrackingStrategy#messageCountBeforeStorage`
|Number of messages before storing.
|10,000

|`AutoTrackingStrategy#flushInterval`
|Interval to check and store the last received offset in case of inactivity.
|`Duration.ofSeconds(5)`

|`ManualTrackingStrategy`
|Enable and configure the <<consumer-manual-offset-tracking,manual tracking strategy>>.
|Disabled by default.

|`ManualTrackingStrategy#checkInterval`
|Interval to check if the last requested stored offset has been actually stored.
|`Duration.ofSeconds(5)`

|noTrackingStrategy
|Disable server-side offset tracking even if a name is provided.
Useful when <<single-active-consumer, single active consumer>> is enabled and an external store is used for offset tracking.
|`false`

|subscriptionListener
|A <<consumer-subscription-listener, callback>> before the subscription is created.
Useful when using an external store for offset tracking.
|`null`
|===

[NOTE]
.Why is my consumer not consuming?
====
A consumer starts consuming at the very end of a stream by default (`next` offset).
This means the consumer will receive messages as soon as a producer publishes to the stream.
_This also means that if no producers are currently publishing to the stream, the
consumer will stay idle, waiting for new messages to come in_. Use the
`ConsumerBuilder#offset(OffsetSpecification)` to change the default behavior and
see the <<specifying-an-offset,offset section>> to find out more about the different
types of offset specification.
====

[[specifying-an-offset]]
===== Specifying an Offset

The offset is the place in the stream where the consumer starts consuming from.
The possible values for the offset parameter are the following:

* `OffsetSpecification.first()`: starting from the first available offset. If
the stream has not been <<limiting-the-size-of-a-stream,truncated>>, this
means the beginning of the stream (offset 0).
* `OffsetSpecification.last()`: starting from the end of the stream and returning
the last <<chunk-definition,chunk>> of messages immediately (if the stream is not empty).
* `OffsetSpecification.next()`: starting from the next offset to be written. Contrary
to `OffsetSpecification.last()`, consuming with `OffsetSpecification.next()`
will not return anything if no-one is publishing to the stream. The broker will start
sending messages to the consumer when messages are published to the stream.
* `OffsetSpecification.offset(offset)`: starting from the specified offset. 0 means consuming
from the beginning of the stream (first messages). The client
can also specify any number, for example the offset where it left off
in a previous incarnation of the application.
* `OffsetSpecification.timestamp(timestamp)`: starting from the messages stored
after the specified timestamp.
Note consumers can receive messages published a bit before the specified timestamp.
Application code can filter out those messages if necessary.

[[chunk-definition]]
[NOTE]
.What is a chunk of messages?
====
A chunk is simply a batch of messages. This is the storage and transportation
unit used in RabbitMQ Stream, that is messages are stored contiguously in a chunk
and they are delivered as part of a chunk. A chunk can be made of one to several
thousands of messages, depending on the ingress.
====

The following figure shows the different offset specifications in a stream
made of 2 chunks:

         |                       |                   |                       |

....

Each chunk contains a timestamp of its creation time.
This is this timestamp the broker uses to find the appropriate chunk to start from when using a timestamp specification.
The broker chooses the closest chunk _before_ the specified timestamp, that is why consumers may see messages published a bit before what they specified.

[[consumer-offset-tracking]]
===== Tracking the Offset for a Consumer

RabbitMQ Stream provides server-side offset tracking.
This means a consumer can track the offset it has reached in a stream.
It allows a new incarnation of the consumer to restart consuming where it left off.
All of this without an extra datastore, as the broker stores the offset tracking information.

Offset tracking works in 2 steps:

* the consumer must have a *name*. The name is set with `ConsumerBuilder#name(String)`. The name
can be any value (under 256 characters) and is expected to be unique (from the application
point of view). Note neither the client library, nor the broker
enforces uniqueness of the name: if 2 `Consumer` Java instances share the same name, their
offset tracking will likely be interleaved, which applications usually do not expect.
* the consumer must periodically *store the offset* it has reached so far. The way
offsets are stored depends on the tracking strategy: automatic or manual.

Whatever tracking strategy you use, *a consumer must have a name to be able to store offsets*.

[[consumer-automatic-offset-tracking]]
====== Automatic Offset Tracking

The following snippet shows how to enable automatic tracking with the defaults:

.Using automatic tracking strategy with the defaults
[source,java,indent=0]
--------
include::{test-examples}/ConsumerUsage.java[tag=auto-tracking-defaults]
--------
<1> Set the consumer name (mandatory for offset tracking)
<2> Use automatic tracking strategy with defaults

The automatic tracking strategy has the following available settings:

* *message count before storage*: the client will store the offset
after the specified number of messages, right after the execution
of the message handler. _The default is every 10,000 messages_.
* *flush interval*: the client will make sure to store the last received offset
at the specified interval. This avoids having pending, not stored offsets in
case of inactivity. _The default is 5 seconds_.

Those settings are configurable, as shown in the following snippet:

.Configuring the automatic tracking strategy
[source,java,indent=0]
--------
include::{test-examples}/ConsumerUsage.java[tag=auto-tracking-with-settings]
--------
<1> Set the consumer name (mandatory for offset tracking)
<2> Use automatic tracking strategy
<3> Store every 50,000 messages
<4> Make sure to store offset at least every 10 seconds

Note the automatic tracking is the default tracking strategy, so if you are fine
with its defaults, it is enabled as soon as you specify a name
for the consumer:

.Setting only the consumer name to enable automatic tracking
[source,java,indent=0]
--------
include::{test-examples}/ConsumerUsage.java[tag=auto-tracking-only-with-name]
--------
<1> Set only the consumer name to enable automatic tracking with defaults

Automatic tracking is simple and provides good guarantees. It is nevertheless
possible to have more fine-grained control over offset tracking by using
manual tracking.

[[consumer-manual-offset-tracking]]
====== Manual Offset Tracking

The manual tracking strategy lets the developer in charge of storing offsets
whenever they want, not only after a given number of messages has been received
and supposedly processed, like automatic tracking does.

The following snippet shows how to enable manual tracking and how to store
the offset at some point:

.Using manual tracking with defaults
[source,java,indent=0]
--------
include::{test-examples}/ConsumerUsage.java[tag=manual-tracking-defaults]
--------
<1> Set the consumer name (mandatory for offset tracking)
<2> Use manual tracking with defaults
<3> Store the current offset on some condition

Manual tracking has only one setting: the *check interval*. The client checks
that the last requested stored offset has been actually stored at the
specified interval. _The default check interval is 5 seconds_.

The following snippet shows the configuration of manual tracking:

.Configuring manual tracking strategy
[source,java,indent=0]
--------
include::{test-examples}/ConsumerUsage.java[tag=manual-tracking-with-settings]
--------
<1> Set the consumer name (mandatory for offset tracking)
<2> Use manual tracking with defaults
<3> Check last requested offset every 10 seconds
<4> Store the current offset on some condition

The snippet above uses `MessageHandler.Context#storeOffset()` to store at the
offset of the current message, but it is possible to store anywhere
in the stream with `MessageHandler.Context#consumer()#store(long)` or
simply `Consumer#store(long)`.

====== Considerations On Offset Tracking

_When to store offsets?_ Avoid storing offsets too often or, worse, for each message.
Even though offset tracking is a small and fast operation, it will
make the stream grow unnecessarily, as the broker persists offset
tracking entries in the stream itself.

A good rule of thumb is to store the offset every few thousands
of messages. Of course, when the consumer will restart consuming in a new incarnation, the
last tracked offset may be a little behind the very last message the previous incarnation
actually processed, so the consumer may see some messages that have been already processed.

A solution to this problem is to make sure processing is idempotent or filter out the
last duplicated messages.

'''

_Is the offset a reliable absolute value?_ Message offsets may not be contiguous.
This implies that the message at offset 500 in a stream may
not be the 501 message in the stream (offsets start at 0).
There can be different types of entries in a stream storage, a message is
just one of them. For example, storing an offset creates an offset tracking
entry, which has its own offset.

This means one must be careful when basing some decision on offset values, like
a modulo to perform an operation every X messages. As the message offsets have
no guarantee to be contiguous, the operation may not happen exactly every X messages.

[[consumer-subscription-listener]]
====== Subscription Listener

The client provides a `SubscriptionListener` interface callback to add behavior before a subscription is created.
This callback can be used to customize the offset the client library computed for the subscription.
The callback is called when the consumer is first created and when the client has to re-subscribe (e.g. after a disconnection or a topology change).

WARNING: This API is *experimental*, it is subject to change.

It is possible to use the callback to get the last processed offset from an external store, that is not using the server-side offset tracking feature RabbitMQ Stream provides.
The following code snippet shows how this can be done (note the interaction with the external store is not detailed):

.Using an external store for offset tracking with a subscription listener
[source,java,indent=0]
--------
include::{test-examples}/ConsumerUsage.java[tag=subscription-listener]
--------
<1> Set subscription listener
<2> Get offset from external store
<3> Set offset to use for the subscription
<4> Store the offset in the external store after processing

When using an external store for offset tracking, it is no longer necessary to set a name and an offset strategy, as these only apply when server-side offset tracking is in use.

Using a subscription listener can also be useful to have more accurate offset tracking on re-subscription, at the cost of making the application code slightly more complex.
This requires a good understanding on how and when subscription occurs in the client, and so when the subscription listener is called:

* for a consumer with no name (server-side offset tracking _disabled_)
** on the first subscription (when the consumer is created): the offset specification is the one specified with `ConsumerBuilder#offset(OffsetSpecification)`, the default being `OffsetSpecification#next()`
** on re-subscription (after a disconnection or topology change): the offset specification is the offset of the last dispatched message
* for a consumer with a name (server-side offset tracking _enabled_)
** on the first subscription (when the consumer is created): the server-side stored offset (if any) overrides the value specified with `ConsumerBuilder#offset(OffsetSpecification)`
** on re-subscription (after a disconnection or topology change): the server-side stored offset is used

The subscription listener comes in handy on re-subscription.
The application can track the last processed offset in-memory, with an `AtomicLong` for example.
The application knows exactly when a message is processed and updates its in-memory tracking accordingly, whereas the value computed by the client may not be perfectly appropriate on re-subscription.

Let's take the example of a named consumer with an offset tracking strategy that is lagging because of bad timing and a long flush interval.
When a glitch happens and triggers the re-subscription, the server-side stored offset can be quite behind what the application actually processed.
Using this server-side stored offset can lead to duplicates, whereas using the in-memory, application-specific offset tracking variable is more accurate.
A custom `SubscriptionListener` lets the application developer uses what's best for the application if the computed value is not optimal.

[[single-active-consumer]]
===== Single Active Consumer

WARNING: Single Active Consumer requires *RabbitMQ 3.11* or more.

When the single active consumer feature is enabled for several consumer instances sharing the same stream and name, only one of these instances will be active at a time and so will receive messages.
The other instances will be idle.

The single active consumer feature provides 2 benefits:

* Messages are processed in order: there is only one consumer at a time.
* Consumption continuity is maintained: a consumer from the group will take over if the active one stops or crashes.

A typical sequence of events would be the following:

* Several instances of the same consuming application start up.
* Each application instance registers a single active consumer.
The consumer instances share the same name.
* The broker makes the first registered consumer the active one.
* The active consumer receives and processes messages, the other consumer instances remain idle.
* The active consumer stops or crashes.
* The broker chooses the consumer next in line to become the new active one.
* The new active consumer starts receiving messages.

The next figures illustrates this mechanism.
There can be only one active consumer:

.The first registered consumer is active, the next ones are inactive
[ditaa]
....
                    +----------+
             +------+ consumer + Active
             |      +----------+
             |
+--------+   |      +=---------+
+ stream +---+------+ consumer + Inactive
+--------+   |      +----------+
             |
             |      +=---------+
             +------+ consumer + Inactive
                    +----------+
....

The broker rolls over to another consumer when the active one stops or crashes:

.When the active consumer stops, the next in line becomes active
[ditaa]
....
                    +=---------+
                    | consumer + Closed
                    +----------+

+--------+          +----------+
+ stream +---+------+ consumer + Active
+--------+   |      +----------+
             |
             |      +=---------+
             +------+ consumer + Inactive
                    +----------+
....


Note there can be several groups of single active consumers on the same stream.
What makes them different from each other is the name used by the consumers.
The broker deals with them independently.
Let's use an example.
Imagine 2 different `app-1` and `app-2` applications consuming from the same stream, with 3 identical instances each.
Each instance registers 1 single active consumer with the name of the application.
We end up with 3 `app-1` consumers and 3 `app-2` consumers, 1 active consumer in each group, so overall 6 consumers and 2 active ones, all of this on the same stream.

Let's see now the API for single active consumer.

====== Enabling Single Active Consumer

Use the `ConsumerBuilder#singleActiveConsumer()` method to enable the feature:

.Enabling single active consumer
[source,java,indent=0]
--------
include::{test-examples}/ConsumerUsage.java[tag=enabling-single-active-consumer]
--------
<1> Set the consumer name (mandatory to enable single active consumer)
<2> Enable single active consumer

With the configuration above, the consumer will take part in the `application-1` group on the `my-stream` stream.
If the consumer instance is the first in a group, it will get messages as soon as there are some available. If it is not the first in the group, it will remain idle until it is its turn to be active (likely when all the instances registered before it are gone).

====== Offset Tracking

Single active consumer and offset tracking work together: when the active consumer goes away, another consumer takes over and resumes when the former active left off.
Well, this is how things should work and luckily this is what happens when using <<consumer-offset-tracking, server-side offset tracking>>.
So as long as you use <<consumer-automatic-offset-tracking, automatic offset tracking>> or <<consumer-manual-offset-tracking, manual offset tracking>>, the handoff between a former active consumer and the new one will go well.

The story is different is you are using an external store for offset tracking.
In this case you need to tell the client library where to resume from and you can do this by implementing the `ConsumerUpdateListener` API.

[[consumer-update-listener]]
====== Reacting to Consumer State Change

The broker notifies a consumer that becomes active before dispatching messages to it.
The broker expects a response from the consumer and this response contains the offset the dispatching should start from.
So this is the consumer's responsibility to compute the appropriate offset, not the broker's.
The default behavior is to look up the last stored offset for the consumer on the stream.
This works when server-side offset tracking is in use, but it does not when the application chose to use an external store for offset tracking.
In this case, it is possible to use the `ConsumerBuilder#consumerUpdateListener(ConsumerUpdateListener)` method like demonstrated in the following snippet:

.Fetching the last stored offset from an external store in the consumer update listener callback
[source,java,indent=0]
--------
include::{test-examples}/ConsumerUsage.java[tag=sac-consumer-update-listener]
--------
<1> Set the consumer name (mandatory to enable single active consumer)
<2> Enable single active consumer
<3> Disable server-side offset tracking
<4> Set the consumer update listener
<5> Fetch last offset from external store
<6> Return the offset to resume consuming from to the broker
