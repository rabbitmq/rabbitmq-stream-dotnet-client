The RabbitMQ Stream .NET Client is a .NET library to communicate with the [RabbitMQ Stream Plugin](https://rabbitmq.com/stream.html). It allows to create and delete streams, as well as to publish to and consume from these streams.


The client is distributed via [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RabbitMQ.Stream.Client/).

Please refer to the [documentation](https://rabbitmq.github.io/rabbitmq-stream-dotnet-client/stable/htmlsingle/index.html) ([PDF](https://rabbitmq.github.io/rabbitmq-stream-dotnet-client/stable/dotnet-stream-client.pdf)) to find out more.

    ```
    git tag -a -s -u GPG_KEY_ID -m 'rabbitmq-stream-dotnet-client v1.0.0' 'v1.0.0' && git push && git push --tags
    ```
* Ensure the build for the tag passes: [link](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-stream-dotnet-client/actions)
